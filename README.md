# Odd Tandberg mockup

This is just another creative project of mine. 

In this case, I based my myself on graphic art by Odd Tandberg (a renown Norwegian artist).

It is a fun excercise that puts my CSS skills to work and challenges me to push my learning curve, always seeking out new styling techniques.
